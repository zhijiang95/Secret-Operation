			<h2>What is Secret Operation</h2>
			<p>Secret Operation is a gamified application, where using historical information
				from the State Library of Queensland - The Queenslander newspaper photographs
				1914-1918 data set, we aim to deliver an interactive multi-player
				gaming experience, designed to bridge the generation gap between
				young and elder family members, and bestow historical education.
				Using the multiple player gaming style, the game allows two people
				to role play as a commander and recruit, and they complete various
				tasks as part of their overall mission. </p>
