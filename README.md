# Secret-Operation
Secret Operation is a gamified application, where using historical information from the State Library of Queensland - The Queenslander newspaper photographs 1914-1918 data set, we aim to deliver an interactive multi-player gaming experience, designed to bridge the generation gap between young and elder family members, and bestow historical education. Using the multiple player gaming style, the game allows two people to role play as a commander and recruit, and they complete various tasks as part of their overall mission.
