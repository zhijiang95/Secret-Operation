The party lived at this inhospitable spot on Elephant Island until Sir Ernest Shackleton rescued them, after they were driven out of the ice hole. - The pack ice is seen choking the bay, while in the background are the glaciers from which avalanches were always threatening to fill the bay and by the waves so created to sweep the explorers off the spot. - In the foreground members of the expedition are seen skinning the Gento penguins which formed their principal food for 4 months. - Caption: Saved at Last. The scene on Elephant Island when on August 30, 1916, at the fourth attempt, Sir Ernest Shackleton succeeded in reaching the island and getting off the 22 men whom he had left there when he set off on his wonderful journey of 750 m - The party had been 4 months on the island, and practically all the time had subsisted on the penguins and seals they caught, limpets and seaweed.
